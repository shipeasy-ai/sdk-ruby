# Admin API client (optional) — `Shipeasy::Admin`

The base SDK *evaluates* flags, configs, and experiments
([`configure`](configuration.md) + `Shipeasy::Client.new(user)`). The **Admin API
client** is a separate, optional surface for *administering* a small, deliberate
slice of those resources from server code.

It is **intentionally lean** — three capabilities, seven operations, not the
whole admin API:

| Capability           | Operations                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| File a public ticket (client key) | `create_public_bug`, `create_public_feature_request`                                              |
| Toggle a kill switch | `toggle_killswitch`                                                                               |
| Manage a whitelist   | `get_gate_whitelist`, `set_gate_whitelist`, `add_to_gate_whitelist`, `remove_from_gate_whitelist` |

Everything else in the admin API — listing, generic CRUD, experiments, metrics,
events, configs, i18n, projects, connectors, keys — is deliberately **not** here.
Reach for the Shipeasy CLI or MCP for those; they speak the complete spec.
Keeping the vendored contract small is what keeps the generated client small.

It is **off by default**: `require "shipeasy-sdk"` never loads it, and its HTTP
dependency (`faraday`) is optional. Require it explicitly:

```ruby
require "faraday"
require "shipeasy/admin"
```

The client is **generated from the Shipeasy OpenAPI spec**, so it is a raw, 1:1
projection of the REST API: `snake_case` methods, id-based paths, typed request
models. It does *not* add the percent→basis-point conveniences you get from the
Shipeasy CLI/MCP — reach for those tools when you want the ergonomic surface, and
for this client when you want a typed, programmatic mirror of the API.

## Authenticate and scope

Mint an **admin** SDK key (`sdk_admin_…`) and scope every call to a project.

```ruby
admin = Shipeasy::Admin::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV.fetch("SHIPEASY_ADMIN_KEY"),        # Authorization: Bearer <key>
  project_id: ENV.fetch("SHIPEASY_PROJECT_ID"),    # sent as X-Project-Id on every call
  # Only needed for the two public ticket operations — see "File a public
  # ticket" below. They send it as X-SDK-Key, on the edge host.
  client_key: ENV["SHIPEASY_CLIENT_KEY"],
  # base_url defaults to https://shipeasy.ai; use http://localhost:3000 for local dev
)
```

`project_id` is sent as the `X-Project-Id` header on every request. It is
optional on the constructor — individual operations also accept an explicit
`x_project_id:` option to override per call.

## File a public ticket

Two dedicated endpoints, so there is no discriminator to set and no fields from
the other kind in the request. Both accept just a `title`.

These two are the **public** intake, and they differ from the other five
operations in three ways worth knowing before you call them:

- They authenticate with a **client** key (`sdk_client_…`) carrying the
  `tickets:public_create` scope — not the admin key. Client keys are meant to be
  embedded in shipped code, which is the point: a CLI, an installer, or a
  browser bundle can file a ticket without holding an admin credential.
- They are served by the Shipeasy **edge worker** (`api.shipeasy.ai`), not the
  admin API host. The generated client already routes them there.
- Every item is filed as `pending_approval`, parked out of the work queue until
  a human promotes it in the dashboard, and repeat submissions of the same title
  dedupe against the open ticket already tracking them (HTTP 200 with
  `deduped: true` instead of a second ticket).

The project is the key's own project — there is no project id to pass and no way
to file into someone else's queue. The project must have public ticket creation
enabled.

```ruby
filed = admin.ops.create_public_bug(
  Shipeasy::Admin::Generated::CreatePublicBugRequest.new(
    title: "Checkout 500s on Safari",
    steps_to_reproduce: "Open the cart on iOS Safari and tap the price row.",
    actual_result: "The primary CTA overlaps the price.",
    priority: "high",
  ),
)
puts filed.number

admin.ops.create_public_feature_request(
  Shipeasy::Admin::Generated::CreatePublicFeatureRequestRequest.new(
    title: "Dark mode",
    use_case: "Reduce eye strain at night",
  ),
)
```

## Toggle a kill switch

`toggle_killswitch` reads the current value and publishes its opposite in one
call. Every body field is optional, so it widens from "flip it" to "set exactly
this, on this environment". The body rides in `opts` because the spec marks it
optional:

```ruby
ks = "payments.checkout" # id (ksw_…) or name
Req = Shipeasy::Admin::Generated::ToggleKillswitchRequest

# Flip the kill switch itself on prod — no body at all.
admin.killswitch.toggle_killswitch(ks)

# Flip one nested sub-switch on prod (created off→on if it doesn't exist yet).
admin.killswitch.toggle_killswitch(ks, toggle_killswitch_request: Req.new(switch_key: "eu_region"))

# Set it idempotently — a retry can't undo the first call.
admin.killswitch.toggle_killswitch(
  ks, toggle_killswitch_request: Req.new(switch_key: "eu_region", value: true),
)

# …on a chosen environment.
result = admin.killswitch.toggle_killswitch(
  ks, toggle_killswitch_request: Req.new(switch_key: "eu_region", value: true, env: "staging"),
)
puts "#{result.previous} -> #{result.value}" # false -> true
```

Omitting `value` (or passing `nil`) means **flip**; passing an explicit
`true`/`false` means **set**. Omitting `env` targets `prod`.

## Manage a flag's whitelist

A gate's whitelist is the always-first allowlist that admits named identities
before any targeting rule or percentage rollout runs — the same list the
dashboard's Whitelist block edits.

```ruby
gate = "new_checkout" # id (gate_…) or name
G = Shipeasy::Admin::Generated

wl = admin.flags.get_gate_whitelist(gate)
puts wl.attr, wl.entries # "email" ["alice@acme.dev"]

# Let one more person in (idempotent — already-listed entries are skipped).
admin.flags.add_to_gate_whitelist(gate, G::AddToGateWhitelistRequest.new(entries: ["bob@acme.dev"]))

# Revoke one.
admin.flags.remove_from_gate_whitelist(
  gate, G::RemoveFromGateWhitelistRequest.new(entries: ["bob@acme.dev"]),
)

# Pin an exact list, re-key onto user ids, or clear it entirely.
admin.flags.set_gate_whitelist(gate, G::SetGateWhitelistRequest.new(attr: "user_id", entries: ["usr_123"]))
admin.flags.set_gate_whitelist(gate, G::SetGateWhitelistRequest.new(entries: []))
```

`set_gate_whitelist` is the only call that can switch `attr` or drop the block —
`entries: []` removes the whitelist from the gate. Adding to a whitelist keyed on
the other attribute is rejected with a 409 rather than silently re-keying
everyone already listed.

## Resource groups

Each resource group is a lazily-constructed, memoized reader: `#flags`,
`#killswitch`, `#ops`. Those three are the whole surface.

The exact method names, request models, and response shapes come straight from
the spec — explore them under `Shipeasy::Admin::Generated`.

## Escape hatch

`admin.api_client` exposes the underlying generated `ApiClient` for advanced use
(custom headers, retries, a shared Faraday connection).

## Regenerating

The generated code lives under `lib/shipeasy_admin*` and is committed.
`admin/openapi.json` is **not** the full Shipeasy spec — it is the dedicated
server-SDK contract, hand-authored in the monorepo as
`marketplace/openapi/spec/openapi-sdk.yaml` and bundled to `openapi-sdk.json`.
Do not hand-edit it, and do not replace it with the full `openapi.json`: that is
what bloats the generated client back to megabytes.

From the monorepo, re-vendor and regenerate in one step (only the generated
files are rewritten, never the `Client` shim):

```bash
pnpm sdk:spec:regen sdk-ruby
```

A monorepo pre-commit hook blocks any commit that changes the admin spec while
this vendored copy is stale, so the two cannot silently drift.

The generator version is pinned in `openapitools.json`.
